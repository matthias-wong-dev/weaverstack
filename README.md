# Weaverstack

Weaver is a data-engineering framework for Microsoft Fabric. It coordinates
Lakehouses, Warehouses, OneLake, Spark and T-SQL from one project, with a shared
dependency graph and persistent operational state.

## Installation

Weaver requires Python 3.11 or later and is tested on Python 3.11 and 3.13.

```bash
python -m pip install weaverstack
```

## Minimal example

Create a project containing the Sales example, then build it into a Fabric
workspace:

```bash
weaver initialise \
  --workspace Analytics \
  --project-folder ./analytics \
  --lakehouse Landing \
  --example \
  --non-interactive
cd analytics
weaver build
```

With `--non-interactive`, Weaver uses a configured service principal or Azure
CLI sign-in and does not open a browser.
